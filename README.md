# Algebraic Combinatorics Blueprint

This repository is the Verso port and integration repo for `Algebraic Combinatorics Blueprint`.

- Upstream formalization: `algebraic-combinatorics/`
- Shared harness: `tools/verso-harness/`
- Harness config: `verso-harness.toml`

## Pages

- Public site: configure after GitHub Pages is enabled for this repo
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/blueprint.yml` via the upstream `verso-blueprint` reusable workflow
- Local build: `bash ./scripts/ci-pages.sh`
- Local output: `_out/site/html-multi/index.html`

## Port Source

The written-mathematics source of truth remains the legacy TeX / leanblueprint
material identified by `tex_source_glob` in `verso-harness.toml`.

For normal blueprint and integration work in this repo, treat the upstream
formalization checkout at `algebraic-combinatorics/` as read-only unless you are
explicitly doing upstream or fork work there.

## Workflow

This repo is a consumer of the shared harness. For startup, retrofit, LT audit,
and maintenance rules, use the harness docs:

- `tools/verso-harness/README.md`
- `tools/verso-harness/references/start-new-port.md`
- `tools/verso-harness/references/retrofit.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

## Notes

- Root `lean-toolchain` follows the upstream formalization toolchain.
- `lakefile.lean` pins the matching `VersoBlueprint` branch for that toolchain.
- Generic LT commands should be run via `tools/verso-harness/scripts/...`.
